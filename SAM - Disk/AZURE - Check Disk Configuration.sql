--Now we can see the size allocated for the underlying Azure Premium Disks for every database file:
SELECT db = db_name(database_id), name, size_gb, azure_disk_size_gb
FROM mi.master_files;

--Sum of the azure disk sizes should not exceed 35 TB â€” otherwise you will reach the azure storage limit errors. You can check total allocated azure storage space using the following query:
SELECT storage_size_tb = SUM(azure_disk_size_gb) /1024.
FROM mi.master_files

--Using this information, you can find out how many additional files you can add on a managed instance (assuming that new file will be smaller than 128GB):
SELECT remaining_number_of_128gb_files = 
(35 - ROUND(SUM(azure_disk_size_gb) /1024,0)) * 8
FROM mi.master_files

--This is important check because if this count became zero, you will not be able to add more files of database on the instance.
